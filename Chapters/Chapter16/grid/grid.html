        <h2>Introducing: Breads of the World!</h2>
        <p>
          It seems as though every region of the world has its own special take
          on this staple of humankind. From crusty french baguettes to
          table-sized Afghan flat-breads, breads can come in all shapes, sizes,
          and textures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each month, we feature a bread that is the specialty of a particular
          culture or part of the world. Some will be made in-house by our bakers
          who travel around the world learning regional techniques in order to
          bring them back for you to try. Other breads will be provided by local
          bakeries that have been making bread for their communities for
          generations.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you are in the bakery, we encourage you to give our featured
          Bread of the World a try. If you can't make it to the shop, many of
          our breads will be available for purchase online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Providing you with fresh, unique breads is one of the things that
          makes Black Goose Bakery proud.
        </p>
        <!--
