			<h1>St. Martin is named a top winter travel destination by Flipkey!</h1>

			<h5>Prepared by: Carlos A. Machin Hernandez</h5>

			<p>
				It was recently announced that St. Martin was recognized by FlipKey,
				TripAdvisor’s vacation rental company, as a Top Winter Travel
				Destination. The winners were selected based on traveler feedback and
				industry research. Criteria for consideration on the list included a
				variety of factors such as energetic culture, authentic cuisine, a
				variety of outdoor activities, and flawless weather. Included in the
				list are other warm weather locations such as: Playa Del Carmen, Mexico
				and Oahu, Hawaii.

				Located 140 miles off the coast of Puerto Rico, the French side of the
				island of St. Martin is ideal for travelers looking for European flair
				mixed with the heartbeat of the Caribbean. With average temperatures
				ranging from 85 degrees Fahrenheit during the day, and “cooling off” to
				75 during the night this island features weather that cold-weather
				locales dream about for a winter getaway. Visiting in December-April
				allows you to experience the Arrowroot Festival and Carnival (the
				biggest party of the year), but you can find the best rates for hotels
				and flights during the quick May/June window.

				Although English is spoken in most hotels, this island is very French
				(right down to the plethora of baguettes.) Speaking of baguettes, two
				staples of St. Martin are food and sun. Marigot is the capital of St.
				Martin and features the best food and shopping on the island. Visit the
				Marigot Market for local fruits, spices, meats, and fishes. You can also
				buy amazing hand-made crafts at the market. The restaurants lining
				Marina Port la Royale on the waterfront (including fan favorites Le
				France and Tropicana) offer delicious menus that make the Caribbean
				taste come alive.

				The terrain has something for everyone. There are mountains, coves,
				bays, and beaches. The most popular and developed beach is Orient Bay.
				It is a fabulous spot for snorkeling, parasailing, jet skiing and more
				aquatic sports. With live music and a clothing optional policy, this
				beach is not for the prudes. For a more family-themed beach visit, check
				out Friar’s Bay that has much more swimmable, calm waters than the
				strong undertow featured at Orient Bay. For the hikers and adventurers,
				visit Loterie Farm and take a trip on their new zip line.

				If you’re looking to get away this winter as artic temperatures take
				over the entire country, look no further than St. Martin for all the sun
				and sand you so desperately need.
